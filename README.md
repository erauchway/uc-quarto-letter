# UC Letter Format Template
This is a Quarto template that provides you with an old-school University of California letterhead, put together using [Rob Hyndman's Monash template](https://github.com/numbats/monash-quarto-letter) and the old UC LaTeX template originally created in 1993 and modified in 2000 by Marcelino Enriquez and in 2020 by Chris Hoofnagle. The idea is to swiftly author letters with UC letterhead using the Quarto system.

The repository includes a template that lets you see the options, which include the ability to set your UC campus, to provide your home department address, email, and telephone number, and other similar information including a graphics signature file.
